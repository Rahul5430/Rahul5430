## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Rahul Sharma, a **Full Stack Web Developer** pursuing my Bachelors in **Electronics & Communication Engineering** from [**Punjab Engineering College**](https://pec.ac.in/).

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and am really enthusiastic about learning new technologies.

📚 Outside the world of tech too, I love reading books on **business** & **financial literacy**. My favourites ones are **Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping our Future** by _Ashlee Vance_ in the genre of personal development and **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by _Robert Kiyosaki_ in the genre of financial literacy.
